# TLA+
TLA+ is a high-level language for modeling programs and systems - especially concurrent and distributed ones.

## Getting started
### To learn
[Leslie Lamport's excellent video lecture series](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html)

[TLA+ GitHub](https://github.com/tlaplus)

### To work
Download the TLA+ Toolbox (IDE): [Zenobius release, TLAToolbox-1.6.0](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases/)

Download the command-line tool: [tla-bin](https://github.com/pmer/tla-bin)

[TLC command-line options](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tlc-options.html?back-link=tools.html)

## Command-line tool
The command line tool allows one to load `.cfg` files directly into TLC (the model checker). Each spec is contained in a `.tla` file, e.g. `Spec.tla`. An associated model for this spec and corresponding config are generated by the toolbox and named something like `SpecMC.tla` and `SpecMC.cfg`, respectively. To check this model with this configuration for this spec, put these three files in the same directory and from that directory, use the TLC command-line tool with `-config` option:
```
  $ tlc SpecMC.tla -config SpecMC.cfg
```
